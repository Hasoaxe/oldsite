<h1>Replying to issues/suggestions</h1>
<ul>
<li>"ramerhead (blocked) schoolisfunpublicvm" Thanks for the suggestion, but I cannot add this because ramerhead is not static and I cannot host it on github pages. Even if I could, the file size would be too big.</li>
<li>"plz add some proxies ;)" fine bruh but if they get blocked then i cant do anything about that. i dont wanna have to do what sharky does and constantly checking if they are blocked and trying to get new ones from the discord. if i find some by mistake then sure i might add it but otherwise this might be it.</li>
<li>"idk, try to add geforce or smth. Then like EVERY kid would go crazy 4 this site. Also, awesome site, love it." bruh how would i add geforce now? please elaberote. im so counfussed brosky</li>
<li>"Make Interstellar" bruh, how you expect me to CREATE Intersteller blud. alr so quick lesson. Intersteller is a Proxy. Proxies work by having your computer search as if it was in a diffrent location and everything, you might say "why cant the school just make all searches on the laptop go thru lightspeed filter agent?" well they try but sometimes the system doesnt know you are searchign so it lets you thru. So theres something called a static site, and a dynamic site. All you need to know is that github pages (im using) hosts static, and proxies are dynamic. So in order to host a proxy i would need to buy a real domain like a .com. There are cheaper ones but thats the type of domain i mean. unless i can figure out how to monitize this shit i will not be hosting a proxy.</li>
