<h1>Replying to issues/suggestions</h1>
<ul>
<li>"ramerhead (blocked) schoolisfunpublicvm" Thanks for the suggestion, but I cannot add this because ramerhead is not static and I cannot host it on github pages. Even if I could, the file size would be too big.</li>
<li>"plz add some proxies ;)" fine bruh but if they get blocked then i cant do anything about that. i dont wanna have to do what sharky does and constantly checking if they are blocked and trying to get new ones from the discord. if i find some by mistake then sure i might add it but otherwise this might be it.</li>
<li>"idk, try to add geforce or smth. Then like EVERY kid would go crazy 4 this site. Also, awesome site, love it." bruh how would i add geforce now? please elaberote. im so counfussed brosky</li>
<li>"Make Interstellar" bruh, how you expect me to CREATE Intersteller blud. alr so quick lesson. Intersteller is a Proxy. Proxies work by having your computer search as if it was in a diffrent location and everything, you might say "why cant the school just make all searches on the laptop go thru lightspeed filter agent?" well they try but sometimes the system doesnt know you are searchign so it lets you thru. So theres something called a static site, and a dynamic site. All you need to know is that github pages (im using) hosts static, and proxies are dynamic. So in order to host a proxy i would need to buy a real domain like a .com. There are cheaper ones but thats the type of domain i mean. unless i can figure out how to monitize this shit i will not be hosting a proxy.</li>  
<li>"your the best make it better" ok :skull: just released 1.4 soooo ye</li>
<li>"(my partners name) is cool" I agree, lol.</li>
<li>"UBG100.Github.io" bro what does this mean. alr imma take a guess, you want me to add it. i dont know what that is lol and it is blocked. but fine i will try to find the repo, im such a good person.</li>  
<li>"why did you embed the sites into the website? i prefer it when it opens to a different tab. (as an 8th grader, people usually use personal gmails when responding to things like this and not their school gmail.) (also why is the tab named "is the moon landing fake" like its annoying when ppl come up to me asking why i have that tab open)" Alr so I embeded it as the first part to stop the people that dont type the password (they can still bypass curently but soon hopfully not) I can try to see if i can either get fullscreen for them or just also put password on the new tab it opens. Its just a little hard to do that bc i didnt code like 3kh0 so i might mess something up but hopfully i can just add a function. and yeah ik for the home emails its just weird that sevies dont lol. I can change the title i just didnt know what to put it as.</li>
<li>"none of the 3kh0 games are working" yeah bro i need to import so many folders which takes so long cause github is annoying, and i dont have the time to do so because of school. </li>
<li>"In 3kHO for me only a few games at the top work and the rest just say 404 page not found." yeah i need to import the folders.  i just dont have time bro. if someone could maybe help me then yeah but otherwise it might take a month or 2 before i have enough free time. school is js being so annoying.</li>
