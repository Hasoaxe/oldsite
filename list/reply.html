<ul>
<li>"ramerhead (blocked) schoolisfunpublicvm" Thanks for the suggestion, but I cannot add this because ramerhead is not static and I cannot host it on github pages. Even if I could, the file size would be too big.</li>
<li>"plz add some proxies ;)" fine bruh but if they get blocked then i cant do anything about that. i dont wanna have to do what sharky does and constantly checking if they are blocked and trying to get new ones from the discord. if i find some by mistake then sure i might add it but otherwise this might be it.</li>
