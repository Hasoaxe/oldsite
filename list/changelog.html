<h1>Changelog started at update 1.4</h1>
  <p>This changelog also functions as a way for me (boatu) to yippity yap when i feel like it.</p>
  <h1>1.4</h1>

  <p>YOOO important question, do i make a changelog? it would be alot of work and whenever i make a big change i have to list everything. but it would mean you guys could know like when links are fixed or what is going on. if i can figure out how to make a poll, i will add it here. </p>
  <p>I swear bro why are the only people that use this like sevies bro, like all the forms are from sevies and i dont put all of them on the reply page. well ig the ones that are 8th use their own emails. also quick PSA: dont use this on school email its way easier for them to get the browsing data, they still can on your home, only the searchs you make on the computer, they dont have control over your whole google account though, but it is way harder.</p>
