<p>Password system: So a friend of mine made a list of proxies a while back and had a password system with anti inspect and stuff, I took his code and then made a bunch of changes and improvements to fit with this project and to have less bugs. Currently the Password system uses session storage, meaning if you refresh it should prompt you with the password. -Hasoaxe</p>

<p>iframe: The iframes and iframe divs to display the diffrent sites and the list are made by me with alot of help from ChatGPT.-Hasoaxe</p>
    <br>
<p>Divs: The divs for the list and the actual game sites are made by me but ChatGPT did help me alot.-Hasoaxe</p>

<p>General bug fixing: So the hidden person and I have done alot of bug fixing with some help from ChatGPT. ChatGPT has gotten the site to actually work so many times, it finds the major syntax errors i cant. An example is when trying to get 1.4 up, i had switched between quotes and apostrophies so many times to fix a problem, but i still after checking a couple times a single quote where a apostrophie should have been was there. Another thing was when trying to get 1.3 (second password update) to work, the prompt wouldnt appear sometimes as i was trying to get session storage to work, ChatGPT again helped me by adding some code including one that loads the javascript after the sites html loads, Along with many small minor errors and bugs.-Hasoaxe (much more tho)</p>
