<h1>About</h1>
<p>Heyyy, so im a person right. Some people know who <b>I</b> am, but no one knows who the person that has the actual authority over this is. you will never know hehe. this project was created for funzies. if you want to request a game site then go back to home and scroll down to the bottem, you will see a link to github, click it. Make a issue and tell me the bug/game site you would like to be added.</p> 
<p>I totaly didnt create and add proxies to the proxies tab like 30 minutes before math test lol</p>
<br>
<p>i have been working on this website/reposittory/just networking and doing various needed but time consumming tasks (legal stuff.) so whenever i try to change stuff i have to do alot more before i can. Another reason is that people keep bypassing stuff and its kinda upsetting. But for 3kh0, the Github staff decided to take down the repo because of like stealing stuff. All the forks of his repo are gone includng mine! There are backups but they are weird. The solution is downloading the files then importing them but its so time consuming as the ma size per upload is 25mb and only max 100 files at a time so it would take a while. I have done this with the other things but most of them are much easier and still some dont work. </p>

 <h1> Im back (slightly)</h1> 
  <p> imma be doin a lil but not rly that much just trying to fix 3kh0 and shadow games then probaly gone again.</p>
