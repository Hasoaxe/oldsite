<h1>About</h1>
<p>Heyyy, so im a person right. Some people know who <b>I</b> am, but no one knows who the person that has the actual authority over this is. you will never know hehe. this project was created for funzies. if you want to request a game site then go back to home and scroll down to the bottem, you will see a link to github, click it. Make a issue and tell me the bug/game site you would like to be added.</p> 
<p>I totaly didnt create and add proxies to the proxies tab like 30 minutes before math test lol</p>

<p>Hey this might come as a suprise or sadness, but I (Hasoaxe) will stop working on this for the time being. My grades have been dropping a bit because instead of using my free time to do the work im supposed to do at home (I dont do homework or any schoolwork at home) i have been working on this website/reposittory/just networking and doing various needed but time consumming tasks (legal stuff.) Until futher notice boatu and the mystery person shall be the sole contributers. From time to time I might help or answer questions about my vision and how my code works, but otherwise it will be up to them to continue the site. Don't worry they both are talented, and experienced. I am almost 100% sure I will resume work by the end of this school year, but as I have mentioned my grades are dropping from A's, A-'s, and B+, to B's and B-'s. Ight Haso out.</p>
